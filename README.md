## Troubleshooting

- Getting `globals.css` error?
  Run the project again, it caches the tailwind files once we run the project and next time picks up from that.
- Getting aliasing issues between packages and expo app?
  While running the project, clear the metro cache.
  ```bash
  npm run web -- --reset-cache
  ```
